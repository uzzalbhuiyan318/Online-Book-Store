This project is a web-based e-commerce platform dedicated to selling books online. It is designed for a single administrator (store owner) who manages all books, orders, and customers, and for customers who browse and purchase books. The goal is to provide a smooth, secure, and user-friendly online bookstore experience tailored for Bangladesh — supporting BDT currency, local payment gateways (bKash, Nagad, Rocket), and Cash on Delivery (COD).
