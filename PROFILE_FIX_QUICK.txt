# Profile Fix - Quick Summary

## THE REAL PROBLEM
Template and view were using WRONG field names that don't exist in the User model!

## User Model Fields (ACTUAL)
✅ `full_name` - CharField (stores name)
✅ `profile_image` - ImageField (stores photo)
✅ `phone` - CharField (stores phone)
✅ `email` - EmailField (login field)

## What Template Was Trying (WRONG)
❌ `first_name` - doesn't exist
❌ `last_name` - doesn't exist
❌ `profile_picture` - doesn't exist (it's profile_IMAGE)
❌ `date_of_birth` - doesn't exist
❌ `gender` - doesn't exist

## The Fix

### 1. Updated accounts/views.py
```python
# Changed from:
user.first_name = request.POST.get('first_name', '')
user.last_name = request.POST.get('last_name', '')
user.profile_picture = request.FILES['profile_picture']

# To:
user.full_name = request.POST.get('full_name', '').strip()
user.phone = request.POST.get('phone', '').strip()
user.profile_image = request.FILES['profile_image']
```

### 2. Updated templates/accounts/profile.html
- Changed `profile_picture` → `profile_image`
- Removed `first_name` and `last_name`
- Added single `full_name` field
- Removed `date_of_birth` and `gender` fields (don't exist in model)

## What Now Works
✅ Full name updates and saves
✅ Phone number updates and saves
✅ Profile image uploads and saves
✅ Email displays (disabled, can't change)
✅ Success message shows
✅ Data persists in database

## Testing
1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/profile/
2. Change full name
3. Change phone
4. Upload image
5. Click "Update Profile"
6. Should see success message and changes saved!

## Files Modified
- accounts/views.py (profile function)
- templates/accounts/profile.html (form fields)
